# Crowdfunding_ETL
Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project 2

I have uploaded the following:
  - ETL_Mini_Project_HKIP - it is the Jupyter Notebook for the project.
  - Resources folder - it contains all the dataset for the project and the export of the data frames.
  - crowdfunding_db_schema - it is the SQL file for creating the schema tables and verifying that each table has the correct data imported from the csv files in "Resources" folder.
  - ERD(QuickDBD) - it is the Entity Relationship Diagram.
